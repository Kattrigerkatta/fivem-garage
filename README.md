# Simple ESX Garage
Customised version of a Garage Script for SkullFace's server. It provides functionality to store vehicles at different locations around Los Santos.

**Features**
- Easy to use UI
- Highly configurable 
- Store vehicles in garages across the map to be kept safely
- Optional Vehicle recovery with customisable cost ( so the vehicles are not lost when disconnected )
- Optional Vehicle towing ( teleports vehicles from the street if no players inside )
- Optional ability to take out vehicles from any garage, regardless of stored garage

# Installation

From your resouces directory for the ESX server:
```
cd "[esx]"
rm -rF esx_garage
git clone https://github.com/Lachee/fivem-garage.git esx_garage
```

This will replace the previous garage with this one.
